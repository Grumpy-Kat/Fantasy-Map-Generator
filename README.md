# Fantasy-Map-Generator
A fantasy map generator made in Unity and C#.
It's procedurally generates pixel art land masses using layered Perlin noise and preset biomes based on terrain height. It also generates resources using perlin noise with a visual display to easily edit types and number of resources. Moreover, it generates kingdoms, with random names, with cellular automata.

## Features
- Layered perlin noise generation for land masses.
- Customizable layered perlin noise generation for various resources, such as coal, iron and gold. Easily add more or less resources and adjust their settings.
- Cellular automata to generate kingdom borders with random names and populations.
- Unity editor tool for biome and resource setting editing.

## Planned Futures
- Improve river generation.
- Create cities, towns, and trading ports in the kingdoms based on favorable locations.
- Kingdom traits based on available land, such as one mores focused on farming due to ample flat terrain or more industrial ones due to limited space and high population density.
- Randomly generate kingdom leaders with traits.
- Basic economy with kingdom trading with each other.
